# IOT (IOT based home automation Solution in picsimlab and MPLab X IDE , MPLAB Xc , Compiler)
The project is designed to develop empowering homes with smart iot-based inlate valve 
and outlate valve automation solutions in PICSimLab. PICSimLab is a real time emulator of 
development boards with integrated MPLABX/avrgdb debugger. PICSimLab have 
integration with MPLABX/Arduino IDE for programming the boards microcontrollers. As the 
purpose of PICSimLab is to emulate real hardware it does not have any source code editing 
support. 
A homes with smart iot-based inlet valve and outlet valve automation solutions on 
microcontrollers, aimed at enhancing convenience and efficiency in controlling lights, 
managing temperature , and automating tank operations and provide the notification on 
CLCD display with Blynk Apps. The proposed system leverages the flexibility and versatility 
of microcontrollers to provide an intuitive and centralized control system for homeowners. 
The microcontrollers -based home automation soluations provides an affordable, flexible , 
and user-friendly solution for controlling lights, managing temperature , automating tank 
operations. Its seamless integration with existing household systems and customizable 
features empowers homeowners to enhance their living environments , improve energy 
efficiency, and optimize resource management. 
It is used in several applications, like in smart home, checking proximity and even more 
popularly in smart build electronic devices to assist in smart-parking. We can utilize these 
Read the LDR sensor value, based on the reading from LDR, vary the brightness of the led, 
which resembles controlling garden lights based on the availability of sunlight The 
advantages of this LDR sensor and temperature sensor LM35. when interfaced with 
microcontrollers which is a control and temperature system. 
IOT(Internet of Things) based home automation refers to the use of internet-connected 
devices to control and monitor home appliances and systems. With IOT home automation, 
one can use their smartphone or other internet-connected devices to control and monitor 
your home appilances. The system can also be programmed to perform certain tasks or 
routines automatically, such as turning on off the light , heaters or other devices. 
Blynk iot applications and picsimlab simulator , simulated home solution where LED , 
temperature system , serial tank resembles Light , Heater , Cooler and water tank in real 
time. CLCD acts like a dash board used for displaying the events , widgets from Blynk iot 
app like button widget are used to control heater , cooler and inlet valve , outlet valve.
